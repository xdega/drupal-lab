# Drupal Lab

This is a simple learning repo for investigating development workflows, experimenting with backend edits, and general exploration with the framework.

The master branch is intended to be a running a Drupal 8 Application, with support for a cross-platform Docker environment. The goal is to provide a means for rapid development, testing, and deployment with minimal fuss on Windows, Linux, or Mac.

## Contributing 

Pull requests should only be for the purpose of improving the Docker development environment or providing support for testing frameworks.

Edits to any of the source files, theming, and mods should be done in their own feature branch. These branches can then be used to implement independent repos for more serious projects.
